* Two devices to get the .d64 image to the C64s (see optionals)
* Two cables from [C64 to s-video](https://ilesj.wordpress.com/2012/11/17/c64-s-video-cable-the-easy-way-and-with-no-scart/), read more [here](https://ilesj.wordpress.com/2012/11/17/c64-s-video-cable-the-easy-way-and-with-no-scart/)
* Two identical beamers, i.e. [Dell 2400mp](https://github.com/6510nl/RealD-3D/blob/main/documentation/Dell2400MP.pdf)
* Reflective 'silver' screen or decorate [a wall using aluminum foil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_foil)
* Two circular polarized filters, we use [RealD 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealD_3D) type filters
* RealD 3D glasses (Pathé uses them)


# Optionals

* [1541U2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1541_Ultimate) combined with [USB2LAN (Asix AX88772/-A/-B)]() adapters
